The proposal should include the following information:
- Name of project
- Type of project: Data (A1/A2) or API Client (B)
- Brief description of the purpose
- Links to data sources / API etc. - Outline the technical steps / challenges you plan to address and include in your submission.
- Are there any significant hurdles that you have doubts about? Would not solving them render the project incomplete?
